# Advanced-R--Code-Review

Author: Elizabeth Sicking

## Description: 

This project is for analyzing the emergence timing of aquatic insect families from 3 sites over a six week period.

- My project focuses on the influence of historic hydrologic patterns on benthic macroinvertebrate and emergent insect communities in isolated wetlands. For this specific project, I was focused on performing NMDS on a small subset of my emergence data, to visualize whether the community was distinct at separate sampling periods.

## Materials needed to run the script: 

R file: NMDSEmergeTiming.R

.csv file: nmds_site.csv
